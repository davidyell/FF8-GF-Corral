#Final Fantasy VIII Corral
An application to organise your Guardian Forces so that you can maximise the junction coverage on your team or teams.

##Premise
The idea is that when your team gets stripped of all their GF's you have to spend time working out which ones go on which character to ensure that all your characters can have as many stats junctioned as possible without having any overlaps, such as one character having two HP-J.
